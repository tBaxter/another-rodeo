  {% figure img_path thumb "Modern engineering hiring still feels like trying to have a conversation while both parties are standing precariously on beams high above the ground." %}

Over the past five years or so, I have interviewed and hired well over 100 engineers -- along with quite a few Product Managmeent and UX roles -- and have had exactly two bad engineering hires. In one case I was pressured into hiring a candidate I did not want to hire, and in the other case a fraudulent hire slipped through before we closed that particular gap. Other than that, I've made fantastic engineering hires, and I struggle to think of a developer I've hired that I wouldn't hire again. 

I've also talked with dozens and dozens of engineering leaders about how they hire and researched the interviewing and hiring processes across dozens and dozens of companies. Most of them lament the difficulty in consistently hiring solid engineering talent. Some say it's all just luck.

Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a >99% sucess rate, consistently hiring great engineers. So let me walk you through how I do it, and why.

### Evaluating the likelihood of success beats evaluating candidate skill.
At most companies, the hiring process starts something like this: "We need a frontend dev who knows React, is familiar with Tailwind CSS and can shore up our accessibilty needs. Go to the question bank and pick some questions to filter for those people." Now, a frontend dev who is solid in React, Tailwind and a11y is likely a pretty useful front end dev. 

But chances are, if that's how you're going into the interview, you're approaching it in a way that may not yield results

1. You think you're evaluating the candidate, but that's only a fraction of what you need to do.
2. You're preparing interview questions prematurely. They aren't the important part.

#### Start with evaluating the core traits you need to see.
At every company, if they're being honest with themselves, certain traits indicate who will thrive and will flounder. Maybe you need people who self start. Maybe you need people who are great at navigating bureaucracies. You know your organization: what makes a difference there?

Here's a sampling of some core traits I've found it worth filtering for. Your mileage could vary. And probably should. Every organization is different.
