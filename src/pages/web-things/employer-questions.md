In May of 2021 I was working at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) in a term-limited role, so I was actively interviewing. As I interviewed I realized that companies always asked me if I had any questions for them, and more often than not I completely froze and couldn't think of any questions at all in that moment. Not a great look.

So I started compiling good questions. But the recovering journalist inside me knows: with any interview, a good question alone isn't enough. You need to understand why you're asking the question and what you hope to learn from it.  So as I compiled the questions, I added notes on scenarios in which it might be a useful question and signals -- both good and bad -- to watch for. 

Over time it's grown to be a pretty large collection I've [kept on Github](https://github.com/tBaxter/questions-for-employers). It will remain there, but I'm also embedding it here as a convenience.
