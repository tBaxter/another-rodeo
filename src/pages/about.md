### April 8
I skipped some small updates over the past few weeks, but today sees the launch of some fairly major typography and hero image changes. 

### Mar 15
I've recently added a linkroll and [links page](/links), along with a page [about me](/about-carter). I'm thinking a bit about the [about | ideas |now model](https://aboutideasnow.com/about) but don't honestly know if I want to keep up with updating all those pages. Seems like a lot.

I've also been making CSS tweaks here and there. I need to take a harder look at the CSS. It is currently broken on small screens, I'm not sure my color choices are accessbible, and I don't love the way it's organized and builds. 

### Feb 22

I've needed to fix the site navigation for awhile now, and finally did. I used the simple [11ty Navigation Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/) and it was so easy it made me a bit embarrassed that I hadn't fixed it already. 

### Feb 7

I've added a lot more content this week as I consolidate various things I've had on other websites and bring it all here. That means my Smart Camper content is here now and I'll be retiring smartercamper.com, and I've started bringing over a bunch of the bike content from re-cycled.net. I'll be retiring that one, too. 

I've also pulled in the Giant List of Questions for Prospective Employers. I'm experimenting with embedding that here as a Github submodule. We'll see how well it works.

And I added a bunch of photos and thumbnails.

### Jan 30, 2024

As I begin to diverge from the perfectly nice [11ty Netlify jumpstart template](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart/generate), I've changed the main logo image and theme colors. Those who have known me for awhile will recognize the horseshoe isn't just a nod to this site's name, it's also the same horseshoe found on Gretsch guitars, in particular the Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins. I created the Gretsch Pages in 1995 and over time it became the leading resource and community for Gretsch guitar owners. After 25 years I retired, but not without some regrets. It was a huge part of my life for a very long time. Just seemed right to have a little homage here.


## We're doing it live

I'm Carter Baxter. I like to tinker with things. You can read more about me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carter-baxter/), on [Github](https://github.com/tBaxter), or on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@tbaxter). 

This site is a little clearinghouse for various experiments and projects I've taken on and tinkered with. Because it's all about the projects, we'll treat the site as a project, too, and build it out live. 

We're starting from the [11ty Netlify jumpstart template](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart/generate) and going from there. If I don't abandon the project, it should be constantly changing. We'll see where it goes.

## Template Languages Used

Page templates are created as Nunjucks (`.njk`), and feature are added that expect Markdown for most page content.


## Layout Hierarchy and Features

There are two layouts and one partial included.

**New in v1.1.0** - layouts are customized to be located in `src/_layouts`.

- `_layouts/base.njk` includes the standard HTML boilerplate including meta and "og" tags in `<head>`.

- `_layouts/page.njk` includes the `sitenav.njk` partial and chains up to `base`

The `src/index.njk` template chains to the `base` layout and includes a loop that will create "cards" for everything in `collections.pages`.

## Expected Frontmatter

There are only two fields expected:

- `title` - essentially required, by default is used in the page `<title>`, and in the layout "hero".
- `description` - optional, by default appears below the title for the `page` template and is used as for the "description" meta tag.

> If you want typed front matter, consider my plugin for [collection schemas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@11tyrocks/eleventy-plugin-collection-schemas)

## Permalink Style

The default setup expects content - using any template language - within `pages/`.

The `pages.json` in that directory includes a `permalink` setting so that the file name is used directly to prevent 'pages' being the base of the URL.

You can [override permalinks per file](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/).

## Asset Handling

In the `.eleventy.js` config, there are included "pass-throughs" for an `img/` directory as well as `favicon.png`.

You can replace the included favicon, and create an `img` directory or remove the `addPassthroughCopy` if you do not have need of images.

Creating an `img` directory and keeping the pass-through directive will make images available at `/img/[image-file-path]` relative to the site root.

## Linting

A `prettier` config is included, with the only update being `printWidth: 100`.

## Sass Framework

Review the [styling documentation](https://5t3ph.github.io/html-sass-jumpstart/) for the included minimal Sass framework, particularly the theme variables, to quickly customize the starter.

The only notable differences are:

1. `sitenav` - adjust the styles for the navigation header that appears on pages
1. `tdbc-anchor` - styles for the `#` anchor that appears next to page headings ([or turn that feature off](#anchor-links)) can be adjusted in `sass/_utilities`
1. Additional `article`-scoped styling for typography as it appears on `pages`
1. A theme for the [`prism` syntax highlighting](#prism-syntax-highlighting) for code blocks. You can adjust or replace the theme in `sass/_prism`.

Additionally, the Sass in this starter is processed using LightningCSS by way of my plugin: [@11tyrocks/eleventy-plugin-sass-lightningcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@11tyrocks/eleventy-plugin-sass-lightningcss). This affords you access to some super modern CSS features, if you choose to use them.


## Anchor Links

Anchor links next to headings throughout Markdown content are generated by an add-on plugin for `markdownIt`.

This feature can be adjusted or removed in the `.eleventy.js` config file.

## Generated Features

### Sitemap

A `sitemap.xml` is generated from all available content.

To exclude non-page or non-public content from the sitemap, include `eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true` in frontmatter, or [create a custom filter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/#advanced-custom-filtering-and-sorting).

### RSS Feed

An RSS feed is included, and output at `[siteurl]/feed/feed.xml`.

If publishing from Netlify, the included `netlify.toml` file will create a redirect so that the feed becomes available at `[siteurl]/feed`.

## Prism Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting of inline or code blocks found within Markdown content is provided by Prism via `@11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight`.

You can change the theme used in `sass/_prism.scss`.

Or, remove the plugin if you are not in need of code highlighting.

## .eleventy.js Config Features

### Overrides

- **Input directory**: `src`
- **Output directory**: `public`
- **Layout directory**: `_layouts`

Also, `markdownLibrary` is extended to add the `markdownItAnchor` plugin for [anchor links](#anchor-links).

### Shortcode: `year`

Returns the current `YYYY` year, used by the footer copyright.

### Filter: `slug`

Makes the default `slug` function more strict to ensure things like excluding emojis and enforcing lowercase.

## VSCode Tips

### Nunjucks

If you haven't previously worked with Nunjucks, you will want a syntax highlighting extension: [Nunjucks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ronnidc.nunjucks)

In addition, you may want to ensure Emmet works on `.njk` files by updating/adding the following in the `settings.json`:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
	"nunjucks": "html",
},
```

### Formatting

As noted previously, a `prettier` config is included, and you may want to get the
Prettier extension and update your VSCode settings to "Format on Save".

However, to format template files Prettier doesn't recognize like `.njk`, you can update the "Language Mode" on the currently open file from "Nunjucks" (or other current templating language) to "HTML" to allow formatting to be applied. Then, flip it back to re-allow the syntax highlighting if needed.

This is located in the VSCode bottom toolbar near the right-hand side and will display the value of the current file's detected language. Click the name to open the selector.
