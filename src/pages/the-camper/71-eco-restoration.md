## 1971 Eco camper restoration

In 2019 I became convinced that we should have a camper. And not just any camper, we should have a fiberglass "egg" camper. Through a highly improbable coincidence, it turned out a friend had one and he was willing to sell it to me for "friend price." And so I lugged this little thing home. The pictures and story here are incomplete and fractured because I'm recreating the restoration story from whatever files I can find, but I'll recreate it as best as I can.

  {% figure img_path "as_found.jpg" "As I found it, it had seen better days. It looked a bit like a baked bean, and smelled a lot like old, rotten beans." %}

  {% figure img_path "garage.jpg" "It just *barely* fit in my garage bay. That made the restoration a lot easier. Just go out to the garage and get to work." %}

  ### So what is this thing, anyway?

  In the '60s a company called Boler pioneered these little fiberglass "egg" campers. Where most campers at the time nailed aluminum into a wooden structure to make the camper (or in the case of Airstream, an aluminum frame) these were different: there  was no framework for the body, because the fiberglass is self-supporting.  So they're extraordinarily lightweight, easy to tow, and much less likely to break, leak or just fall apart. 

  Through a complicated series of events I won't get into here, Boler's original fiberglass molds ended up in the hands of a bunch of different manufacturers, including this Eco, which was built in Nebraska in 1971. I'm told the factory later specialized in fiberglass prosthesis when they got out of trailer-building. 
  
  Anyways, the original Boler design continues on today under the Scamp name. Pretty amazing longevity, but great design endures. If you're interested, there's [a lot of history about them out there](http://www.boler.ca/2017/03/05/history-of-the-boler/).

### The teardown

I was lucky it was such a great design and couldn't rot. At least I didn't have to worry much about the body. But everything inside sure could rot. And had.

When I brought it home, my wife would not step foot in it. To her credit, it really was pretty disgusting. There was carpet in it that had seem some terrible things and a smell that could stop traffic.

  {% figure img_path "70s-floor.jpg" "Underneath the disgusting carpet the original  super-70s linoleum was still in place, albeit covered in 50 years of funk. This is the dinette side of the grailer. A few hours after this picture was taken, the cushions and linoleum joined the carpet on the curb-side trash pile." %}

  {% figure img_path "upper-cabinets.jpg" "There are cabinets above the sink/kitchenette area. The doors, light fixtures and backsplash were all in terrible condition." %}

  {% figure img_path "sink.jpg" "The sink itself was no better. But it did have lots of extra holes for whatever reason." %}

  {% figure img_path "overhead.jpg" "The overhead storage and the front and rear was notable mostly for the sheer number of hooks that you were absolutely certain to hit your head on." %}

 The very first thing I did was remove every fibrous surface from inside and put it all in the trash. All the cushions, the drapes, everything. If it was porous, it got yanked out and thrown out. I also found some other things I'd rather forget about, like the ancient camping toilet. Ugh.

  {% figure img_path "trash.jpg" "Won't be wanting any of that anymore." %}

Everything that was left was bleached, then gone over with a trisodium phosphate (TSP) cleaning solution, and then painted over with a couple of coats of Killz. There was a lot of mold, a pretty good ant infestation, and a couple of dead rodents.

  {% figure img_path "funky.jpg" "Too much of it looked like this. No, I don't know what all that was, either. But it smelled as bad as it looked." %}

  {% figure img_path "killz.jpeg" "By the time this photo was taken I was deep into bleaching the whole interior and hitting it with TSP and then Killz primer ." %}

  {% figure img_path "primered.jpg" "Eventually, it started to became a nice clean bare white canvas." %}

  {% figure img_path "fiberglass-holes.jpg" "The fixtures and shelving, like the body, are all fiberglass. I filled a lot of holes in them. Then I filled a lot more." %}

  {% figure img_path "stove.jpg" "I didn't have a lot of faith in this 50-year-old propane stove, nor did I really want to be cooking eight inches away from where I'd be sleeping." %}

  {% figure img_path "dinette-stripped.jpg" "Here the kitchen unit is nearly completely stripped down, with the original sink and stove gone. You can also see where I filled in some more holes on the front. I didn't need to fill the ones on top because I was building a new countertop. " %}


### Troubleshooting power issues
Having a usable electrical system in the trailer was quite a journey. When I first bought the trailer, I plugged it into 110V household power and got... nothing. As I investigated more, I learned two things:

1. The original power center for it had long ago been gutted, with the original transformer removed and a nonsensical bit of splicing put in its place. Electricity was going places, but not the places you'd want it to go, and definitely not in the right wires.
2. That length of household wiring laying out on the trailer tongue, going nowhere? It was hooked up directly to the 110V shore power. So it's probably good that I didn't touch it. 

Seriously, the more I dug in, the more it was clear the existing wiring was just flat dangerous. Major work was going to be needed.

  {% figure img_path "power-center.png" "The dangerous remnants of the original power center." %}

So after some research I placed an order for a <a href="https://amzn.to/2wZfLRR">Progressive Dynamics 4145 Power Center</a>. It's compact, full-featured and packs more than enough potential power for my little trailer.

Before I could do anything to install the new power center I had to drill out the rivets holding the old power center in place, then significantly enlarge the height of the hole for the new power center. A few minutes with a drill to mark the corners and a jigsaw to cut through the fiberglass and that was done. <em>Note: Be sure your eyes, skin and mouth are well-covered. Fiberglass is nasty stuff.</em>

  {% figure img_path "power-center.jpg" "You can see my marker lines where I had to enlarge the hole for it to fit." %}

But my newly cut hole was about 1/8" too wide because of the width of the old power center. So I had to turn right around and put some trim around the new hole to keep my new height while narrowing the opening a smidge.

  {% figure img_path "power-center-trimmed.png" "Trimmed and caulked. You can see the red fiberglass putty filling some more holes too." %}

With the hole trimmed out and painted, I still had to figure out how to wire it up, which was pretty tricky and figuring out a good ground on a fiberglass trailer takes some head scratching. The Progressive Dynamics instructions were a little inscrutable, too, but with a little thought and a lot of googling, it went in.

  {% figure img_path "power-center-in.jpg" "The new power center installed (shown without its cover in this pic)." %}

On the 110 (household) voltage side, I've got one breaker dedicated to feeding the 12v converter, one dedicated solely to the air conditioner, one dedicated to the refrigerator, and one dedicated to a 110v outlet on the front of the kitchenette cabinet. I could have put more on the circuits, but why? I don't need to, and this way there's less chance of a tripped breaker.

On the 12v side, the 4135 offers more circuits than I've yet found a use for, but the first thing I wanted to do was get some light. I found these <a href="https://amzn.to/2IIZqmW">super-low profile remote control LED puck lights</a> on Amazon and went ahead and ordered them. It'd be nice not doing everything by shop light. I the wall-wart off the puck lights, mounted two in the front, two in the rear, and two over the kitchenette, then wired them up to the 12v supply. Success!

I was pretty proud when I wired it all up and it worked with no extra smoke the first time I flipped the switch.

  {% figure img_path "lighting.jpg" "And now that there's power, let there by light. I got a great deal on a set of low-profile, dimmable remote control LED puck lights dirt cheap on Amazon Prime day and hard-wired them in. There are two at each end and two over the kitchenette, all controlled from a single remote. Six lights is plenty in a 60 sq ft trailer." %}

Once it was the inside was more-or-less safe for humans to be in there, I hitched it up to take to a local trailer shop for inspection. I needed them to tell me that the frame was solid and straight, and remove this weird rack thing that had been added in the rear.

  {% figure img_path "weird_rear_rack.jpg" "The strange rear rack in question. Inside you can see the freshly-Killzed interior." %}

  {% figure img_path "no-rack.jpg" "With the rack gone, the bumper painted and the body halfway clean, it started to turn a bit of a corner." %}

  {% figure img_path "painting.jpg" "The existing paint was so bad, a Rustoleum Roller job in the driveway was actually a step forward. You can get surprisingly good results with a rustoluem roller job. Seriously." %}

  {% figure img_path "paint2.jpeg" "About half-way through painting it was looking pretty good. I needed more coverage, but not bad. You can also see the vent holes on the front for the AC. Those would be important later." %}

  {% figure img_path "wheel.jpeg" "I painted the original wheels with Rustoleum white, too, and fitted some new baby moon hubcaps. You can also see some fiberglass damage from a long-ago blowout. Someday, when I get a pro paint job, I'll have that repaired. I did put new tires and bearings in, though." %}

  {% figure img_path "ext-lights.jpeg" "All the exterior lights were upgraded to modern LED versions. Yes, that's another tiny bit of fiberglass damage by the bumper. It's 50 years old, it's picked up some scrapes." %}

  {% figure img_path "countertop.jpg" "I also started test-fitting a new countertop I'd make from birch plywood." %}

  {% figure img_path "flooring.jpg" "And the new flooring went it. Vinyl planks were easy to work with, worked well with the campers irregular edges and lines, and are waterproof and wear well. Pretty much perfect for this usage." %}

    {% figure img_path "ac.jpeg" "A prior owner had cut this hole for the AC, which is pretty far from ideal as far as cooling efficiency goes, but since the hole was already there I put a fresh AC in it. I spent a lot of time insulating the hot side of the AC from the cold side and figuring out how to vent the hot side. Eventually I put in three temperature-activated 4-inch fans venting to the outside. When the AC is on, they sense the heat and turn on, pushing the hot air out of the trailer." %}

  {% figure img_path "test-fit.jpeg" "A lot of things were being test-fit here, particularly the new countertop, a new bar-sized faucet and the backsplash. You can also see the new electrical outlet (complete with ground fault protection and two USB ports) and over to the right, the new sink waiting to go in. Both the sink and faucet were bar-sized because the scale worked better for the little camper. We decided to skip the propane stove and either cook outside or with a hotplate." %}

  {% figure img_path "kitchen.jpeg" "The kitchenette with it all actually in place." %}

  {% figure img_path "drawer.jpeg" "I was really proud of this drawer I built from scratch, including all the mounting points. The original drawer slid out from the bottom of the stove, and both it and the stove were unsalvageable. So I had to get creative." %}

  {% figure img_path "floorjack.jpeg" "These fiberglass campers need supports from the floor up to the ceiling or else the ceiling can sag and they get oval-shaped. In mine, someone had taken the supports out so I had to use a floor jack to lift the ceiling and install new supports." %}

  {% figure img_path "supports.jpeg" "The supports themselves are just bits of poplar. Some Ikea pegboard helps keep things square while providing some extra utility. This is the sort of usable-yet-attractive detail I just love." %}

  {% figure img_path "cushions.jpeg" "Before I tossed the old cushions I had the good sense to make patterns from them on heavy brown paper. Those were really handy later, when I needed to cut new cushions. The new cushions were cut from a 5-inch memory foam mattress from Amazon, and the houselhold electric carving knife, which is a pretty good solution for cutting foam." %}

  {% figure img_path "upholstery.jpeg" "I don't have an industrial sewing machine or any real upholstery skills, so I figured it was smart to farm out the actual upholstery work. We had the cushions covered in a nice high-quality marine vinyl in a sort of two-tone gray/beige color.  We deliberately kept the colors very neutral and cold. The camper is so small that even a single pillow introduces a lot of color. I made the dinette table, too. Then later I made another one, 'cause I didn't like this one." %}

I had the upholstery done in the late in 2019. By early 2020, the basic renovation of the camper was done and it was a pretty nice place to be.

Of course just a few months later, as the weather just started to warm up, Covid hit, so there wasn't a whole lot of camping going on.

 I turned my attention to modernizing the electronics and entertainment, and making a "smart camper" out of it. That had mixed results but was a lot of fun.

### Why did I do it?

Well, I thought I wanted a camper, and I liked the scale of the renovation project

### What did I learn?

- I don't like camping all that much.

### Where is it?
- Currently, in my garage.
