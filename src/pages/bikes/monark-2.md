  Within days of finishing up the [Monark/Road King resto-mod](/monark-road-king) another rough and down-on-its-luck old cruiser popped up and I couldn't resist. I mean, for $25 it was this or a light lunch at Chipotle. So I bought the bike.

      {% figure img_path "as-found.jpeg", "As I found it." %}

  This one is also a Monark-made frame (a twin to the last one) but without any badges I don't know if it was originally another Road King, or maybe a Monark Rocket, or some other badge-engineered Monark. I just know it's the same frame, and from the same era: mid-to-late 40s.
  
  And it is definitely in rough shape, maybe worse than the last one, with a bad home paint job and plenty of rust. 

  I believe I'll either build this one up as more of a rat rod, or just a nice classic cruiser. Should be fun.
