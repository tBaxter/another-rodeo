For a good chunk of the 80s, touring bikes were a big deal, and most every manufacturer was tripping over themselves trying to one up eveyrone else in the segment. Bike stores were glutted with high quality, supremely comfortable touring bikes with wildly wide-range gearing, high quality steel and mounts galore. It was a lot like today's gravel and endurance bike craze. At least until the bottom fell out.

In the summer of 2021 I decided I wanted one of these classic tourers, and few are more classic than the Trek 520, which had a remarkable 40-year production run from 1983 to 2023.

And so I found this one -- an '88 or '89 model -- and it came home with me.

  {% figure img_path "nasty-brakes.jpeg" "A closer look shows how it really was. The brakes were destroying the gumwall tires, everything was dirty and crusty, and all the cables were rusty." %}

  {% figure img_path "filthy-front.jpeg" "Up front, things weren't looking much better." %}

  {% figure img_path "hose-clamp.jpeg" "I never did figure out what the hose clamp on the stem was all about." %}

  {% figure img_path "dropouts.jpeg" "Once it was on the rack and I started taking it apart I couldn't help but notice all the neat details and craftsmanship the Wisconsin Treks were known for, like these lovely proprietary cast dropouts, and the shifter-cable running through the chainstay." %}

  {% figure img_path "polish.jpeg" "I did spend a fair bit of time giving it a deep clean and polish." %}

I didn't do a lot of parts swapping and modernization on this one. Underneath the grime, they were pretty decent parts, and actually turned out to be in good shape after they were cleaned up and lubed. I swapped out the seat to a Serfas I had, fitted some Panaracer Pasela tires, and just didn't make a lot of other changes. I even kept the original 27" wheels and downtube shifters.

  {% figure img_path "cleaned.jpeg" "Thoroughly cleaned and lubed, pretty close to when it was new." %}

  {% figure img_path "deore.jpeg" "Trek specced an interesting mix of 105 and Deore components for the 520. Back then, Deore was known mostly as a touring bike groupset." %}

  {% figure img_path "deore_rear.jpeg" "These scuffs by the rear derailleur were about the only blemishes in the paint, and I came to see them more as beauty marks, so I didn't attempt to touch them up and instead just put some clear-coat over them to keep the rust at bay. Also, the early Deore derailleurs Trek used are incredibly capable, even today, for anything up to 10 speed and 36 teeth. Amazing, given how old they are." %}

  {% figure img_path "seat_lug.jpeg" "The cast seat lug and arched brake bridge were other lovely details typical of Trek back then." %}

  I just rode it and rode it, enjoying it as Trek had intended all those years ago, while my wrenching attention shifted to another Trek (the 640 photo-bombing above) and a Schwinn LeTour. The 520 just did what it was built to do: gobble up miles with comfort. I _loved_ the way this bike rode.

  {% figure img_path "tree.jpeg" "No matter where I took it, or what I asked of it, the 520 was happy to oblige." %}

  {% figure img_path "pond.jpeg" "Dirt, water, it didn't care." %}

There was just one problem: the Trek was much bigger than it looked. At first I couldn't figure it out... I mean, look at that frame, it's tiny.

And then the math started to make sense: 27" wheels, plus lots of clearance for big tires and fenders, and you start pushing things up. So the 520s tiny 50cm-ish frame had a standover more like a 54 cm frame. I was comfortable riding it, but not so much when I had to stop. It just felt too big for me, so I decided to let it go.

I still miss it, though. It was a great bike that I just couldn't get 100% comfortable on. Someday I may get another one with 700c wheels and see if it fits a bit better.

 I understand the buyer was intending to ride it across Missouri on the Katy Trail. It was built for that, so I'm happy it found a good home.
