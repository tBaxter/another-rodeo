Let's start this story in the middle of the 20th century, when consumer confidence was high, unions were strong, and American factories were working overtime to satisfy consumer demand and new-found discretionary spending. 

Against that backdrop a strange sort of amalgamation of hardware/auto parts/durable goods store was common in even the smallest towns in America. Western Auto and Firestone may have been  best known, for these types of stores, but they were far from the only ones.

At the time, the [Sieberling Rubber Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiberling_Rubber_Company) was one of the biggest tire companies in the US, and just like Firestone and other tire makers, they ran a chain of these odd retail stores, selling their tires, car batteries and other various things... including bicycles, which they sold under their "Road King" brand.

And since Sieberling wasn't in the business of making bicycles, they contracted that work out to several different companies that once dominated US bicycle manufacturing.

So that's how the now largely forgotten [Monark Silver King](https://www.madeinchicagomuseum.com/single-post/monark-silver-king/) bicycle company of Chicago found itself contracted to build this bike:

Which found it's way to me recently.

Monark ceased to exist after 1957, following a buy-out by Huffman/Huffy. Sieberling Rubber made it to the mid-60s before being gobbled up by Firestone, and then later becoming part of the multinational Bridgestone corporation. 

I started out buying a classic cruiser, I got a lesson in America's 20th century manufacturing boom and bust. The bicycle is going to get a lesson in how bicycle technology has progressed over the past 75 years.

But, about that bike: I was wanting to build a classic "[Klunker](https://www.turbochaos.com/cars/what-is-a-klunker-bike/)" and when this one turned up on the local marketplace, I liked the details of the frame. So I threw out a low offer and was surprised when it was accepted. Next thing I knew I was driving a half-hour out of town to pick it up. Once I got it home I took some pics to document the "before" state...

  {% figure img_path "orig-cockpit.jpeg", "At some point long ago it had been repainted. Possibly with house paint. Also, I've never seen a stem quite like that one before." %}

  {% figure img_path "drivetrain.jpeg", "I believe the drivetrain was all original, possibly even down to the pedals. I do know this: our grandparents mashed some big gears back then." %}

  {% figure img_path "seatpost.jpeg", "I really like the filet-brazed frame and the unusual seatstay and chainstay arrangement. I was less thrilled to discover a possible crack by the seat clamp." %}

  {% figure img_path "mesinger.jpeg", "I don't think I'll be keeping this old Mesinger seat. You can get a better view of the neat seatstay arrangement, though." %}

I pretty much immediately began stripping it down, and was really pleased with how easy that went. I was prepared for every bolt to be stripped, a rusted-in-place seat post and stem, and all sorts of other horrors. But really it came apart with no problems, just a little penetrating oil and patience.

  {% figure img_path "stripped.jpeg", "Stripped down, it weighed in at 8 pounds. No featherweight, to be sure, but only a few ounces more than a modern aluminum mountain bike frame I won't shame by name." %}

  {% figure img_path "water.jpeg", "When I took out the rear fender about a half-cup of trapped water came dribbling out of the frame." %}

  {% figure img_path "coldset.jpeg", "Since the frame was originally built with 110mm spacing for a coaster brake hub, it was going to take a BIG cold-set to fit a modern cassette hub in there. It took a lot of patience and careful checking of alignment, but the old steel took the set well. It now sits at 135mm, ready for modern hubs." %}

  {% figure img_path "testfit.jpeg", "Test-fitting with a spare wheel I had laying around. The string is there for double-checking alignment." %}

  {% figure img_path "painted.jpeg", "I really debated what color to paint it, but the bike kept telling me it wanted to be white. So I listened. Here it's been sprayed but still needs final wet-sanding and polishing." %}

And that's as far as I've made it with it so far. I've only had it a week!

Nevertheless, parts are on the way and I'm looking forward to the build. More updates will come soon.

### August 18: Polishing, modernizing & test-fitting

  {% figure img_path "polished.jpeg", "After wet-sanding and polishing, I was pretty happy with the finish." %}

You really can get good results from a rattle-can paint job, but it takes a _lot_ of patience and work. I'm willing to work, but not always patient enough. Nevertheless, I was pretty happy overall with the paint after wet-sanding and polishing, especially considering the number of nicks and divots in the nearly 80-year-old steel. I may still give it a bit more love, but it's really looking pretty good to my eyes. 

The original headbadge also cleaned up nicely. I wish some prior owner hadn't "touched up" the paint, but I'm not going to try to correct it -- it can wear it's history. I just wanted to polish the grime off and bring back some shine.

  {% figure img_path "bb.jpeg", "Conversion kit." %}

I put in a nice [bottom bracket conversion kit](https://amzn.to/3McpS9k) so I can use modern three-piece cranks. I also had a [strong and light Sunlite bottom bracket with chrome-moly spindle](https://amzn.to/3X8qWBl) in the toolkit, so that will save a few grams, too. I considered external bearings and a hollowtech crank, but I'm not sure how well they'd play with the conversion kit, and good quality square taper stuff isn't much heavier at all. Plus I have a lot of good square taper stuff laying around already.

  {% figure img_path "threadless.jpeg", "And another conversion kit." %}

This bike pulled another rabbit out of its hat up front, where I've fitted a [threadless headset](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1526775966/old-school-bmxschwinn-conversion-headset). Basically, these old American frames used a head tube that's within a gnat's whisker of the modern 1 1/8 standard, so some enterprising souls have taken machined about 0.01 inched off a modern alumninum headset and _voila_ it all fits. 

I had a fork I had purchased for the build, but when I put it altogether it looked goofy. So for now I've put a parts-bin GT fork on there, and I actually kinda like it, even in the partially sanded unfinished current state.

  {% figure img_path "test.jpeg", "Testing bars and stem." %}

Since I was throwing some parts-bin bits at it, I added a stem and some bars. Not exactly what I'd envisioned, but I like them for now and the price was right.

### Sept 22: Wheels!

I knew when I decided to paint the frame white that I was going to have to introduce some visual interest elsewhere, so I decided to make some pretty flashy wheels, starting with some [red anodized SE Racing Wheels](https://amzn.to/3ZApOIC). 

Because BMX and cruiser rims are nearly universally 36 holes, I was a little limited in my choices for 36H disc hubs, but Shimano came through with suitable [Deore hubs](https://amzn.to/4edWOdY) for a great price. The whole thing was laced up with double-butted black spokes and chrome brass nipples. They are definitely eye-catching. 

  {% figure img_path "se_rims.jpeg", "Very red rims." %}

  {% figure img_path "front_rim.jpeg", "Lacing the front was straightforward." %}

  {% figure img_path "rear_rim.jpeg", "But lacing up a disc rear was far from straightforward. It just about broke my brain, and I had to lace it up 3 times before I finally got it right. The tape was there to help me keep track of things." %}

  Once they were finally tensioned and trued, I slapped some Schwalbe Billy Bonkers tires on -- probably my favorite 26" tires -- and they were ready for the bike.

  Connecting a derailleur to this thing was going to require an [old school claw hanger](https://amzn.to/4deXApU), and it's surprisingly tough to get a decent one nowadays. A lot of them are very thin and flimsy, or even unthreaded. Next time I take apart an old bike with one, I plan to keep it, as the old ones were clearly made better. But it'll do.

    {% figure img_path "drive_side.jpeg", "There's a lot more happening on the drive side than Monark ever intended." %}

  I dug around in the parts bins and found a little dropout spacer for the other side that I'd saved from some prior project. I wish I knew where I got it, 'cause it's pretty handy.

    {% figure img_path "dropout.jpeg", "Non-drive-side dropout spacer." %}

  I was really surprised by how easy the disc brake conversion went. [Disc brakes](https://amzn.to/3Bbfnkt) are surprisingly cheap, and [the little disc brake converstion/adapter bracket](https://amzn.to/3THrcoT) worked way, way better than I expected it to, at least in this case. They don't work in a lot of cases, but on this bike they worked without much trouble. I was shocked. Everything just worked.

    {% figure img_path "brake_side.jpeg", "The brake side also has a lot more going on than Monark ever intended." %}

  Cables were managed by some little [clip on guides](https://amzn.to/3zw5DAN) that were pretty slick.

  Most of the other stuff was left over from other projects. Pedals, cables, even the crankset, it was all just laying around, so I went ahead and built it up, at least to establish a baseline. 

    {% figure img_path "first_build.jpeg", "Freshly built." %}

    {% figure img_path "rear.jpeg", "The rear" %}

    {% figure img_path "front.jpeg", "And the front" %}

    The baseline is good. It's a fun, fun, fun bike. That said, there are some issues I need to address:

  * I still want those big klunker bars, with a bit more rise.
  *  I need to either pick up a disc brake fork or fit some V-brakes on the front (and risk messing up that pretty red rim).
  * It needs a spacer under the stem. Right now there's too much movement.
  * The disc brake isn't adjusted quite right and tends to squeal.
  * My cabling could be a lot tidier.

  None of this stuff is particularly surprising with such an involved build, and none of it is all that hard to sort out. Expect another update shortly!
