Let's start this story in the middle of the 20th century, when consumer confidence was high, unions were strong, and American factories were working overtime to satisfy consumer demand and new-found discretionary spending. 

Against that backdrop a strange sort of amalgamation of hardware/auto parts/durable goods store was common in even the smallest towns in America. Western Auto and Firestone may have been  best known, for these types of stores, but they were far from the only ones.

At the time, the [Sieberling Rubber Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiberling_Rubber_Company) was one of the biggest tire companies in the US, and just like Firestone and other tire makers, they ran a chain of these odd retail stores, selling their tires, car batteries and other various things... including bicycles, which they sold under their "Road King" brand.

And since Sieberling wasn't in the business of making bicycles, they contracted that work out to a different companies that once dominated US bicycle manufacturing.

So that's how the now largely forgotten [Monark Silver King](https://www.madeinchicagomuseum.com/single-post/monark-silver-king/) bicycle company of Chicago found itself contracted to build this bike:

Which found it's way to me recently.

Monark ceased to exist after 1957, following a buy-out by Huffman/Huffy. Sieberling Rubber made it to the mid-60s before being gobbled up by Firestone, and then later becoming part of the multinational Bridgestone corporation. 

I started out buying a classic cruiser, I got a lesson in America's 20th century manufacturing boom and bust. 

So anyways, on to the bike: I was wanting to build a classic "[Klunker](https://www.turbochaos.com/cars/what-is-a-klunker-bike/)" and when this one turned up on the local marketplace, I liked the details of the frame. So I threw out a low offer and was surprised when it was accepted. Next thing I knew I was driving a half-hour out of town to pick it up. Once I got it home I took some pics to document the "before" state...

  {% figure img_path "orig-cockpit.jpeg", "At some point long ago it had been repainted. Possibly with house paint. Also, I've never seen a stem quite like that one before." %}

  {% figure img_path "drivetrain.jpeg", "I believe the drivetrain was all original, possibly even down to the pedals. I do know this: our grandparents mashed some big gears back then." %}

  {% figure img_path "seatpost.jpeg", "I really like the filet-brazed frame and the unusual seatstay and chainstay arrangement. I was less thrilled to discover a possible crack by the seat clamp." %}

  {% figure img_path "mesinger.jpeg", "I don't think I'll be keeping this old Mesinger seat. You can get a better view of the neat seatstay arrangement, though." %}

I pretty much immediately began stripping it down, and was really pleased with how easy that went. I was prepared for every bolt to be stripped, a rusted-in-place seat post and stem, and all sorts of other horrors. But really it came apart with no problems, with just a little penetrating oil and patience.

  {% figure img_path "stripped.jpeg", "Stripped down, it weighed in at 8 pounds. No featherweight, to be sure, but only a few ounces more than a modern aluminum mountain bike frame I won't shame by name." %}

  {% figure img_path "water.jpeg", "When I took out the rear fender about a half-cup of trapped water came dribbling out of the frame." %}

  {% figure img_path "coldset.jpeg", "Since the frame was originally built with 110mm spacing for a coaster brake hub, it was going to take a BIG cold-set to fit a modern cassette hub in there. It took a lot of patience and careful checking of alignment, but the old steel took the set well. It now sits at 135mm, ready for modern hubs." %}

  {% figure img_path "testfit.jpeg", "Test-fitting with a spare wheel I had laying around. The string is there for double-checking alignment." %}

  {% figure img_path "painted.jpeg", "I really debated what color to paint it, but the bike kept telling me it wanted to be white. So I listened. Here it's been sprayed but still needs final wet-sanding and polishing." %}

And that's as far as I've made it with it so far. I've only had it a week!

Nevertheless, parts are on the way and I'm looking forward to the build. More updates will come soon.
