Hi, I'm **Carter Baxter**, the person responsible for all this. 

I'm a longtime technology veteran (and a Navy veteran) who has been primarily focused over the past eight years or so on civic tech -- leveraging technology to make the US government work better for people.

It's almost never the technology that's the hard part. Making it work better for people is usually the hard part. I try to bring human-centeredness to everything I do.

When I'm not doing that, I have lots of other projects, and this site to document them. I have a huge backlog of stuff I may add here, with all sorts of projects -- 3D printing, a homemade guitar, and other weird experiments and things. 

And then there are other interests that may never make it here, like the programming AI courses I'm taking. I have a lot of interests.

A few of my little side projects can be found out on the web:

- [DSCovery](https://dscovery.fly.dev/) - the Civic Tech Jobs aggregator
- [Pear](https://pear.fly.dev) - a Python Natural Language Processing document comparison tool
- [Not Funny, Dad](https://dadjoke.fly.dev) - A dad joke generator leveraging the fatherhood.gov dad joke API
- [Maturity Model Online](https://maturity-model.online) - A maturity model generator. Not to be taken seriously.

I'll add more to this as I think about, but in the meantime, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carter-baxter/) or [Github](https://github.com/tBaxter) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@tbaxter). If I know you and you ask me nicely, I might share my Manager README with you.
