Hi, I'm **Carter Baxter**, the person responsible for all this. 

I'm a longtime technology veteran (and a Navy veteran) who has been primarily focused over the past 5 or 6 years on civic tech -- leveraging technology to make the US government work better for people.

It's almost never the technology that's the hard part. Making it work better for people is usually the hard part. I try to bring human-centeredness to everything I do.

I'll add more to this soon, but in the meantime, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carter-baxter/) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@tbaxter).
