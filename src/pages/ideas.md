In alignment with the "[About | Ideas | Now](https://aboutideasnow.com/)" model, and because I need to keep track of them somewhere, here are some ideas I have percolating:

## Bikes
I think I want to get my hands on a _very_ vintage cruiser/klunker-type bike and build it up, maybe/probably as an e-bike. This is not a good idea. I already have one very heavy cruiser-type bike. And yet, I kinda want to. I'm thinking of starting with something like this old Schwinn:
{% figure img_path "skiptooth.jpg", "50s Schwinn bicycle." %}

I also think I need to do a 650B conversion on the Trek 640, but my rims have been backordered from Pacenti forever and I don't think I'm ever going to get them.

## Writing
- I'm thinking about collecting good questions for managers who are either new to a role or new to a team
- Call Center-driven development (with credit to some friends for spurring this idea)
