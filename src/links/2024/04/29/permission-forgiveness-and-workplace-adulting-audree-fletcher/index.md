> The amazing Grace Hopper once said “it’s better to get forgiveness than 
> permission”. 
> 
> And I’ve seen plenty of leaders try to cultivate this philosophy among 
> their teams - often feeling frustrated and wanting them to just crack on 
> with what needs to be done instead of seeking permission and waiting for 
> approval. And I feel it’s an admirable ambition in big bureaucracies with 
> traditions of defensive permission-seeking (aka ass-covering).
